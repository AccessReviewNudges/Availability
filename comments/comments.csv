itsec01,You have to concentrate a lot when doing this task.
itsec06,It took quite a while to get an idea who in the gridview belonged to what team exactly but after that it was fine. I might have missed a few but overall i think i did well.
itsec16,Hätte man sich sparen können...
itsec21,Had to read the help file a lot and was sometimes unsure if i understood correctly.
itsec22,It was quite annoing to read the descriptions of the rows because of the format they were presented in
itsec25,I would not say irritated or annoyed. It was just too many conditions at one time. Could not do it without the the paper in my hand
itsec26,very irritating depicition of important information constantly on search for little peaces of infromtaion
itsec100,It was well-structured and explained. I don't have any further comments. Good job!
itsec102,"One would wish a ''mark all'' or ''mark some'' feature."
study001,An interesting survey
study002,no comments
study016,It was good.
study019,no comment.
study025,"The task was mentally demanding but successful. The pace was manageable, and I felt minimal stress. Overall, it was challenging but rewarding."
study027,It was very interesting and I believe i finished all the tasks successfully
study031,None
study034,its a great study
study038,It was interesting.
study042,I tried my possible best to ensure that each employee has just enough access to perform their job effectively.
study044," loved participating, thank you."
study052,The tool was difficult to use - I had to click multiple times because it wouldn't approve after the first click. It also would randomly highlight sections and I couldn't unhighlight
study054,The access review study make things cognitively impressive and the review was fully concentrated on.
study061,"Sorting by different columns helped isolate the functions, departments, and access."

study075,"It was quite tough to decide whom to approve and disapprove, overall it was fun and easy."
study084,No comment for now.

study097,It was alright
study105,This is a task I do at my job quarterly so it was easy to understand. Have a great day!
study106,No comments
study111,This is something AI should do for the most part.
study118,Reading the column headings was kind of a pain and trying to decide if some of the categories that weren't mentioned were simply not meant to be used or were different names for valid categories was a bit annoying.
study123,N/A
study130,"I think I tried my best, I left some reviews undecided but the platform told me to give it a review either rejected or accepted."
study132,This would be easier if I was actually part of the company and had a better internal understanding
study140,NONE
study151,I great study
study154,N/A
study159,"The program did not allow submissions with ''undecided'' (i.e. unchecked entries that were neither ''approved'' or ''removed''). These were for the N&A Maker Legal Approval authorizations which I found no guidance about in the instructions. However, since these authorizations could not be submitted as undecided, I chose to approve as this was the less harmful action to take in the interim."
study160,It needed concentration 
study162,"Instructions were a bit unclear to me, but I guess that is part of the study. "
study164,This was a good task to do
study171,"I felt stressed as for some accesses I felt I did not have enough information to consult in the Help_File, I am not so sure if all of them are correct."

study177,no feedback please
study179,None for now.

study186,survey is interesting and insightful.
study191,it nice 
study194,None
study202,This was really challenging due to the layout of the columns and it was hard to read.
study215,The task was challenging but manageable.
study226,I enjoyed the survey
study228,I enjoyed taking the authorization task.
study239,"The study tells you that you have incomplete tasks, but does not direct you to the incomplte task. I had to download the Excel spreadsheet to determine the one that was missing information. "
study245,Thank you for having me
study247,No
study252,"The instructions were clear, but since I wasn't aware of everything to start it took time to understand the instructions which is frustrating.  "
study257,none
study259,There were a few things that were unclear (primarily the package delivery service). Unsure if it was intentionally done that way but it felt like if my people couldn't ship or receive documents it would mess things up pretty badly.
study263,This was an interesting study.
study264,Thanks!
study272,This was a very interesting organizational study. Thank you for allowing my participation.
study279,No comments.
study285,Thank you very much for the study.
study287,The way the PDF was designed made the task more confusing than it needed to be. Also there was no guidance in the PDF for a sales trainee. The ambiguity related to this could result in errors in terms of granting access. If I was actually doing this for a actual job I would seek out further documents for clarification. 
study290,"I decided to revoke the access of the sales trainee but will probably grant him access later, depending on his performance over the course of his training."
study292,"At the beginning it was a bit confusing, but when I stared and fully looked at it and looked back on the help file grid on the PDF, it became a lot simpler."
study301,nice
study303,"I was mentally invested in the task,going back and forth for references to which employees should have permission granted or removed. My eyes started straining and this was when I felt I was using a moderate amount of mental energy to successfully finish the task."
study304,N/A
study306,"I couldn't believe how annoying it was to do this tedious task. On a trackpad, it was not easy! I felt bad that I was more focused on that than the actual accuracy of the information. Then I felt rushed and worried that I was running out of time because I like to be thorough."
study313,None.
study317,It was a good one
study318,Nice study
study319,"Overall it made sense. I do wish that there was a little more information on who needs what. I read the Help File several times and still am not sure what Greyman Booking is. It wasn't difficult, but it was tedious having to flip back and forth between the Help File and the employee table, especially when something wasn't clear in the Help File."
study326,"This task was moderately demanding but manageable, with steady pace.  There were times I doubled guess myself. Thank you for letting me participate in the study."
study329,"Survey was clear and easy to follow, I probably made some mistakes but overall I think I did a pretty good job after consulting with the help file."
study331,This study had been stressing but mind blowing. I had been mentally challenged this midmorning. I hope this type of study is done again to help participants on this platform challenge their intelligent quotients. Thank you!
study335,Little difficult
study347,Great task. Demanded great attention and thinking.
study348,The task is really demanding
study354,Great study. I enjoyed the task.
study365,"I feel the help file table was somewhat helpful, but could have been more detailed in stating more authorizations for employees of the three teams in the sales departments."
study369,It was fun doing the task!.
study373,Thank you for the opportunity!
study375,Interesting.
study378,It was pretty difficult for me the way it was formatted with everything on top I hope I did it right I tried my best but I'm not 100% confident
study380,It was extremely difficult to read the data on the X axis. 
study383,"I definitely took my time and made sure I didn't make any mistakes. If I did make any mistakes, it was due to a slight misunderstanding of the instructions."
study384,The instructions were quite complicated. It would have been better to do a trial to get a better understanding of the task. 
study385,"This was a fun exercise in reviewing the necessary permissions and looking at each employee's current permissions. I'm moderately confident that I removed all unnecessary access without removing necessary access. There was a tool on the list (I don't recall the name) that a number of employees had access to but that didn't appear in the instructions, so I decided it was a legacy tool no longer needed and removed all access. If you provide feedback on respondents' success rates I'd be interested to see how well I did. Thanks for the opportunity!"
study387,This was fun! I really enjoyed reviewing the access expectations and correcting or approving what access the employees should have!
study399,It was a little complicated at first but along the line I adapted
study401,Thank you for the study! I enjoyed it!
study402,No comment
study403,It was an okay experiment
study405,Too much work for too little pay.
study406,The study was okay.
study408,None
study413,I would love to have a feedback of my performance in this task 
study420,"some of the categories you couldn't even fully read, nor did i know even what all of them meant, even further how am I supposed to know what a position does or does not actually need access to"
study421,"I don't know, I wanted everything to turn out in the best possible way, I wanted to answer in the best way by analyzing the available information, but I know that I may have made some mistakes."
study422,The access review was a valuable exercise in balancing security compliance with operational needs.
study427,Required paying attention and occasional discretion but fairly straightforward overall
study429,"This task was impossible, the directions were not direct and too vague. It was a mess, I doubt anyone could execute this."
study435,It was difficult to decide with overlapping authorizations which was essentially necessary or not for specific subsections of a team or for a secretary or lead as opposed to the general team
study437,Than kyou!
study464,"I really enjoyed this study! However, I do want to mention what slowed down the process was having to always right click to select options as there were many boxes, and if there were letters assigned to what each meant that would've gone easier. It took more time than average to complete the task so I would also stress adding more payment. "

study472,i never did find what the Lpac delivery sevice was in that columon
study475,It was challenging but I think I put in my best effort here. 
study487,No remarks.
study501,There was no notes in the help file about who had access to the actual delivery service not just paying the delivery service.
study509,"I loved this task and would love  to try again in the future! I have a similar workflow with submitting tickets to give access to some employees at work so this was fun to read and learn from, thank you again for all that you do!"

study535,Was an interesting study.
study538,This was a fun task.
study546,A nice study.
